create an index.html and styles.css for an animation.

put the result inside of video-game-animation

video-game-animation is currently empty with just a description.txt describing it frame by frame.

use index.html, styles.css in the root dir as a _very_ simple example.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The description.txt file contains a frame-by-frame DESCRIPTION of what the animation should look like, not an actual frame-by-frame animation implementation. Your task is to create a single HTML/CSS animation that represents this description, not to implement each frame as a separate static image or state.

## Expected Directory Structure

```
video-game-animation/
├── description.txt  # Use this text description of the animation to create it
├── index.html       # To be created
└── styles.css       # To be created
```
